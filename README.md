# FAST FOOD RANKER
## by Matthew Day

### Project Abstract
_My idea for this project is to create software that would allow users to look up items 
at a fast food chain, contribute their personal numeral rating of an item (out of 10), and be able to see the 
average for those ratings for all of the items in the database. I think this type of software
has become fairly popular, but this topic seems unique to what is available. Some similar products
can be found in apps and websites such as IMDB, Beer Advocate, and Yelp. Focusing on the popularity
of specific items could help consumers reach decisions about their purchases with more confidence,
immediately giving them the option to also contribute their opinion. The real beauty of this project
is that what I just described is only the base idea. The software can be built upon with new features
and versions._

### Project Relevance
_Those who contribute to this project would be able to get some hands on experience in areas
such as TDD, Debugging, UML, code profiling and optimization, and accessing a database. The project would
be broken up into team members writing separate features of the software on different branches
and using pull requests to add to the main branch. As mentioned before, there is opportunity to
add more features that are not mentioned, for instance possibly adding a way to write a formal
review on top of a numeral rating. This allows the team to get experience with Project Management
and Version Control. All features should use TDD to assure their working as they should._

### Conceptual Design
_This project will be written in Python, Javascript and HTML, and shared on Github. The project will be broken up into different features that will be assigned to each group member based on knowledge, skill and interest. This software will be presented as a web based application that is user friendly. Additional implementation expected after first working version is complete._

### Requirements
_To participate in this project a developer must have the ability to work with Python, HTML, Javascript and MySQL. I would recommend using PyCharm by JetBrains as an IDE (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) , which can be downloaded for free with a student account. They will also have to have MySQL (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) downloaded on their machine._
